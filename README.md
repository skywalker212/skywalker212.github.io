This is one of my projects of FreeCodeCamp.
This will also serve as my portfolio for the near future.
I'm a begginer level web-developer so some mistakes are going to be there.
In the later parts like my work and contact me, the cards and the form is not resized dynamically according to the screen size, I am lazy so I'm not going to fix that problem.

If you want to contribute to my website or find some issue then just notify me.
