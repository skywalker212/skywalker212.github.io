# Local Weather Site

This is a site which shows the weather of the area in which you currently are by using [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/current#geo). This is a part of an assignment for FCC.

## I need to fulfill these [User Stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story)

- I can see the weather in my current location.  
- I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.  
- I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
