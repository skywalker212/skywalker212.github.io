- I can click the status output and be sent directly to that channel's Twitch.tv channel.  
- I can see whether a channel is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.  
- I can see if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.  
- I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed).  

I'll be using APIs to get the job done.
